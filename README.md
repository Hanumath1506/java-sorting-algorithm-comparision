# Sorting Algorithm Comparison in Java

A Java program that compares the performance of multiple sorting algorithms by measuring execution time on the same dataset.

## Overview
This project evaluates and compares different sorting algorithms to demonstrate their relative performance. By applying each algorithm to identical data and measuring execution time, the program highlights differences in efficiency and time complexity.

## Sorting Algorithms Compared
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- (Optional) Java built-in sort

## How It Works
1. Generates or loads a dataset of numbers
2. Applies each sorting algorithm to a copy of the dataset
3. Measures execution time for each algorithm
4. Displays comparative performance results

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Algorithms
- Performance Measurement
- Arrays and Control Structures
